# A3_Date_Starter BIT 142 Cascadia College
C# Project

## Please consider the following:
 If you clone the project and run it in VS you should be able to enter in the current date and your birth date. The program will then
 calculate the number of days until your birthday, if it is your birthday you will see a nice message. This project was a culmination of all
 the topics in our OOP C# course.
  
```
Open A3_Date --> Open both Birthday.cs & MyDate.cs to see the code developed for this project.
```
